**YearUp-**
*Why is it exciting?*
- Yearup has provided me with an oppertunity to grow. I have become more responsible and learned how to manage my time better. 
- Yearup has provided me with a sense of community. That is an easy thing to take for granted but it is incredibly vaulable.
- Yearup has been challenging but on the other side of those challenges I have found competence. It is exciting to know this I have the ability to learn so much more.

==I am most proud of earning the first Professional of week in my learning community. ==.
