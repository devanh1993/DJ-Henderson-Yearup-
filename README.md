## YearUp- Why is it exciting?
- Yearup has provided me with an oppertunity to grow. I have become more responsible and learned how to manage my time better. 🏫
- Yearup has provided me with a sense of community. That is an easy thing to take for granted but it is incredibly vaulable. 😄
- Yearup has been challenging but on the other side of those challenges I have found competence. It is exciting to know this I have the ability to learn so much more. :
